### Tools & Technologies:
I work with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, Git, Vite, Jest, Electron, and libraries like Howler, Chart.js, Axios, and Express. I'm also exploring SQL and Node.js to expand my skill set.

### Favorite Projects:
🎵 Music Player — a project using Dropbox as a database, where I implemented add, delete, and update functions.
🍴 Calorie Tracker — my first project in React, a great starting point for mastering the framework.

### What drives me?
🌟 The joy of creating and improving what I've built. For me, coding is a creative playground!
